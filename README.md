# Pierre's Bakery
_By Brad Buchholz_
## Description

_Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:_

_There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry._

_When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry._

_A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like._

_The application will return the total cost of the order._

_Pierre offers the following deals:_

* _Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10._
* _Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10._
* _All functionality for the models should be tested._
